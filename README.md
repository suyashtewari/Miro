# Miro
Miro is an online maze-solving game that requires coordinated collaboration between all teammates.

Currently, there only exists a single-player mode. In this single-player mode, there is an underlying maze that the player must navigate. However, on average, half of the squares that the player can move have been obscured. After each valid move, the selection of obscured cells is regenerated.
